CakeCrons
=========

This is a CakePHP plugin to manage task execution with a web frontend in your CakePHP app.
All available taks in your CakePHP app can be managed by CakeCrons.

Requirements
=========
You need a CakePHP 1.3 installation with a working [console](http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Developing-with-CakePHP/The-CakePHP-Console.html)

Installation
=========
1. Create a folder named 'cake_crons' in your 'plugins' directory.
2. Either download the latest release and extract it into 'cake_crons',
   or clone this repository into 'cake_crons' and checkout the latest release.

Customization
=========
1. Setup your [CakePHP ACL](http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Core-Components/Access-Control-Lists.html) for CakeCrons.
   You don't want everyone in the world to access CakeCrons.
2. Perhaps you would like to [override the views](http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Developing-with-CakePHP/Plugins.html#overriding-plugin-views-from-inside-your-application) to fit into your app.
